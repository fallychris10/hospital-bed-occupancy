\vspace{0.3cm}
\\
The technical details refer to the specific tools, platforms, and data sources I used, as well as how they were applied to accomplish the task of tracking and analyzing price movements for local listed securities on the Rwanda Stock Exchange (RSE) in the first half of 2024.
\vspace{0.3cm}

\textbf{1.Software/Tools Used:}
\vspace{0.2cm}

I employed several software tools to analyze, and present data effectively:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Microsoft Excel:}
    \\
    
    Excel was the primary tool for organizing and analyzing stock market data. I used it to track daily stock prices, calculate changes in percentage, and create charts to visualize price movements over time.

    \item \textbf{Rwanda Stock Exchange Online System:}
    \\
    The RSE's online platform provided me with direct access to daily trading data, including stock prices and listings. I used this system to view official data on a daily basis to ensure my analysis was based on the most up-to-date figures. This platform also provided access to information on listed companies, market indices, and regulatory news that impacted stock prices.

\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.4cm}

\textbf{2.Data Sources:}
\vspace{0.2cm}

Accurate and reliable data was critical for tracking and analyzing price movements. I drew from the following sources:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Rwanda Stock Exchange Data:}
    \\
    The official data provided by our Senior analyst included daily stock prices and trading volumes.I downloaded this data directly from the email he sent. This was my primary source of information for local market movements.
    \item \textbf{Historical Data:}
    \\
    I also referred to historical data from previous years (e.g., 2022, 2023) to compare trends. This allowed me to analyze whether price movements followed typical seasonal patterns or were influenced by other factors, such as market disruptions or economic policy changes.
\end{itemize}


\pagenumbering{Roman}
\setcounter{page}{11}


\textbf{3.Data Analysis and Visualization:}
\vspace{0.2cm}

Creating charts  was a key part of the task. I generated line charts to illustrate stock price movements over time These visuals were included in the reports I presented to the senior analyst and investors to make the data easier to understand.
\vspace{0.5cm}

\textbf{4.Collaboration Tools:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Google drive and Email Communication:}
    \\
    Sharing data and reports with team members was an essential part of the workflow. I used Google Drive to store and share large Excel files and reports, ensuring that all team members had access to the latest version of each document. For formal communications, I used email to submit reports to senior analyst and  ensuring he had timely access to the market analysis.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.3cm}

These technical tools and platforms helped me efficiently gather and analyze data, create meaningful reports, and collaborate effectively with my team. By mastering these technologies, I was able to provide accurate, data-driven insights into stock price movements, contributing to informed decision-making within the Rwanda Stock Exchange

\vspace{0.5cm}

\newpage

\begin{flushleft}
    \textbf{\underline{Scientific/Professional Skills Required:}}
\vspace{0.3cm}

To successfully perform the task of analyzing price movements on the Rwanda Stock Exchange (RSE) for the first half of 2024, several scientific and professional skills were required. These skills enabled me to interpret financial data, use analytical tools, and present insights in a clear, concise manner , Also the rule book was very crucial. Below is an explanation of the key skills involved:
\vspace{0.3cm}

\textbf{1.Knowledge of Financial Markets:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item   To read and to understand the Blue Print covers the soft operational infrastructure for the Rwanda Stock Exchange (RSE) which helps me to konw how the stock market operate .  
    \item A strong understanding of how financial markets operate was essential for this task . This includes how stocks, bonds, and other securities are traded, how supply and demand influence prices, and how external factors such as economic events and corporate announcements impact the market.
    \item Specifically, I needed to understand the dynamics of the Rwanda Stock Exchange (RSE), including its listed companies, trading hours, regulations, and the general economic environment within which it operates.
    \item I also had to be aware of broader market trends, both locally and globally, to contextualize price movements.

\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.3cm}

\textbf{2.Data Analysis Skills}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Trend Analysis:}
  \\
  Understanding how to spot and analyze trends was fundamental in predicting future price movements. I applied methods like moving averages and linear regression to identify whether stocks were on an upward or downward trend.
  \item This required knowing when to use short-term (e.g., daily or weekly) vs. long-term (e.g., quarterly or yearly) trend analysis to determine potential investment opportunities or risks.
  
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.3cm}
\newpage

\textbf{3.Attention to Details }
\begin{itemize}
\item Accuracy is essential in financial analysis, especially when dealing with large volumes of data and making important investment recommendations. A small error could lead to incorrect conclusions and decisions.
\item Paying close attention to stock price trends and corporate announcements allowed me to accurately interpret price movements and provide meaningful insights.
\item I had to carefully verify data consistency across different sources, such as ensuring the data I collected from the Rwanda Stock Exchange matched the data on excel.
\end{itemize}


\pagenumbering{Roman}
\setcounter{page}{13}

\vspace{1cm}

\textbf{4.Financial Reporting and Communication }

\begin{itemize}

    \item Writing monthly and quarterly reports summarizing key stock price movements, trends, and the factors that influenced them.
    \item Using technical language appropriately while also making the information accessible to non-experts, such as investors or company stakeholders. 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.4cm}

\textbf{5.Problem-Solving Skills}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Critical Thinking:}
\\

I needed strong critical thinking skills to analyze the root causes behind price movements. For example, if a particular stock experienced a significant drop, I had to investigate whether it was due to company-specific issues (e.g., a poor earnings report) or broader market trends (e.g., changes in government policy).
\item This required me to ask the right questions, analyze data from multiple perspectives, and collaborate with senior analysts to develop well-informed conclusions.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.4cm}

\textbf{6.Collaboration and Teamwork:}

\begin{itemize}

\item Working effectively within a team was important, as I collaborated with senior analysts and junior colleagues in preparing reports. This required clear communication, sharing data efficiently, and providing input into team discussions.

\end{itemize}

\section{\textbf{\huge{Recommendation }}}
\vspace{0.15cm}

Based on my internship experience at the Rwanda Stock Exchange (RSE), I would also suggest extending the internship period beyond 4 weeks. While the 4-week duration provided valuable exposure to the workings of the Rwanda Stock Exchange, it was not enough time to fully grasp the complexities of stock market operations and perform more in-depth analysis, Also I have several recommendations for both future interns and the internship program itself:
\vspace{0.2cm}

\textbf{I}.\underline{Why 4 Weeks Are Not Enough?} Skill Development The 4-week timeframe allowed for basic skill acquisition, but extended periods would provide more time to refine these skills, particularly in data analysis, financial modeling, and technical tool usage. This would better prepare interns for the job market or further academic studies. I recommend that the internship period be extended to at least 8 to 12 weeks.\\
An extended period would also enable a stronger relationship between interns and supervisors, facilitating better guidance and mentorship throughout the internship.
\vspace{0.2cm}

\textbf{II}.\underline{Provide Pre-Internship Workshops or Training:}\\
The school should organize pre-internship workshops focusing on key skills such as professional communication, time management, financial analysis tools (Excel, Power BI, etc), and industry-specific knowledge.
 Many students enter internships without practical knowledge of the tools and techniques used in professional environments. Offering such workshops would better prepare students, enabling them to contribute more effectively and make the most of their internship experience.
\vspace{0.2cm}

\textbf{III}.\underline{Promote Internships in International Organizations?}\\
I Recommend the school should encourage and assist students in securing international internships or placements with multinational companies.

 \vspace{0.2cm}

 By implementing these recommendations, the school can enhance the value and impact of its internship program, ensuring that students not only gain practical experience but also develop the skills and confidence needed to thrive in their future careers.

\section{\textbf{\huge{FAQ}}}
\vspace{0.2cm}

\textbf{Stock}
A stock is a share of a company. It is the unit of ownership. When you buy a share in a company, you own a part of the capital of the capital and you become one of the owners of the company to the extent of the number of shares you hold in the company.

\textbf{Market capitalization}
\\

Market capitalization is simply the market value of a listed company. It is also commonly shortened to 'market cap'. It is arrived at by multiplying the total number of shares forming the capital of a company by the current market price. It changes often as the market price changes. When the price of a stock is rising, market cap also rises and hence the value of the company rises. Companies are compared in the stock market by their market cap. Big cap companies are large and small cap companies are small.
\vspace{0.2cm}

\textbf{Stockbroker}
\\

A stockbroker is an agent of investors in the stock market. They are authorized individuals who can buy or sell securities on behalf of investors. Stockbrokers are usually representatives of companies that are members of a stock exchange.  They act on behalf of investors as well as on their own behalf. When acting on their own, they are referred to as dealers. They earn their income by charging a fee called a commission.

\textbf{What is a share?}
\vspace{0.2cm}

A shares or equity is a unit of ownership in a company.
\vspace{0.3cm}

\textbf{What is a bond?}
\vspace{0.2cm}

A bond is a debt .When you buy a bond, you become a lender. When you buy Treasury Bonds you become a lender to the government and the government is the borrower. Equally when you buy a corporate bond you become a lender to the company. 

Bonds promise to pay interest or coupon at specific intervals of time during until maturity when they pay the back the original principal plus the last interest payment.
\vspace{0.2cm}

\textbf{What is Capital Market?}
\vspace{0.2cm}

A financial system is generally comprised of the money market and the capital. A capital market is a market for securities which could be debt or equity, where business enterprises and government can raise long-term funds. Securities traded in the capital market are usually long dated financial instruments like:
\\

Treasury Bonds, Municipal Bonds, Corporate Bonds and debentures, shares or stocks issued by companies.The capital market is further divided into primary and secondary market.
\\

Primary market
\\

The primary market is the market for new issuers or where new capital is raised. It is the market where securities are sold for the first time. At the primary market sale proceeds of the securities offered flow directly from the buyers or investors to the issuers of the securities.
\\

Secondary market
\\

The secondary market is the market for trading securities that have been sold or issued in the primary market and already in the hands of the public. Once securities have been successfully issued in the primary market, they are subsequently traded in the secondary market. This is where stock markets, stock exchanges or OTC markets by whichever name the market may be referred to, provide the facilities for secondary trading.
\\

The secondary market, provide a very important complement to the primary market. An active secondary market makes it easier for corporate entities and Governments to raise fresh capital through the primary market.
\vspace{0.2cm}

\textbf{CDS account} 
\vspace{0.2cm}

CDS is short for Central Depository System. It is an electronic register of shareholders or bondholders of a company. It is usually used for clearing or settling secondary market transactions instead of the use of the physical paper certificates. When one buys shares where CDS is used, the shares are put in an electronic account instead of being issued with a paper certificate and when they sell the shares are transferred only through an electronic entry. This makes trading faster and less risky. The CDS accounts are hosted by an independent company as a service provider.
